# Meetween
Stream Two Project: Interactive Frontend Development - Code Institute

Meetween is short for 'Meeting in Between' where two people on different 
SMRT East-West Line, Singapore, train stations can find the middle point and 
find out great spots to hang out at.

## UX
Using the app should be easy for the user. Once both locations are selected,
The app should run on it's own immediately.

Filters provided should make it simple for the user to be specific into what 
they are looking for.

The sidebar can be hidden so that the user can maximize their way around looking 
at the map.

## Technologies
1. HTML5
2. CSS3
3. Bootstrap (4.3.1)
4. jQuery (3.4.1)
5. Axios
6. Google Maps API

## Features
In selecting the MRT Stations, it is a dropdown, form-style feature so that if 
the user decide to type in the value, the values are always accurate.

Checkboxes acted as switches so that the user can filter down the results.

## Deployment
This site is hosted using GitHub pages, deployed directly from the master branch.
